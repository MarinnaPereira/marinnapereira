# Olá / Hey there 👋 I'm Marinna ✨
I'm a **Full Stack Web Developer** with a passion for programming and a love for tackling good coding challenges.

🔭 Currently immersed in an intensive 1-year course at DCI – Digital Career Institute, I'm professionalizing in both front-end and back-end development

👩🏻‍💻 In 2022, I transitioned from being a lawyer to pursuing my passion for technology, and I've been on an inspiring journey of learning and creation ever since

🎓 So far, I've mastered the essentials of web development: HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, React, Express.js, and MongoDB

🌱 I'm currently diving deeper into TypeScript

🚀 Eager to explore new and emerging technologies to further enhance my tech skill set

🌍 ✈️ Outside of coding, I'm an enthusiastic traveler, always avid for discovering new places and experiencing different cultures

☕ 🧘 Coffee fuels my coding adventures, while meditation helps me find inner peace in the digital chaos
